# SQLite

These are various SQLite scripts I've written. They worked correctly at the time they were written, for the version of the application at the time.

Although changes to the database structure in applications can happen, the changes have often not impacted the functionality of the script. 

If new, relevant tables or fields are added to a database without affecting those used by the scripts, the scripts will naturally continue to work correctly. But you may end up missing other info of interest. So it's always prudent to examine the tables and fields in a database to make sure there isn't some new data of interest that the script is not capturing for you.
